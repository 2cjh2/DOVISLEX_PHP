TO LOG IN
    To have access to restricted files, please log in by right clicking
    space inside the stars next to the letter "D" in the IT header.
    * other languages currently do not have the right click access
    
    A pop up will show up and ask you to enter name and password.
    Please enter "admin" for the name and "adminpassword" for the password.



TO LOG OUT
    To log out, please click on "logout" button located in any of the 
    restricted pages 

    A pop up will show up and ask you to enter name and password.
    This time, please enter "logout" for the name and "logout" for the password.



CURRENT USERS
    username: admin     password: adminpassword

    * admin has access to "page1.php", "page2.php", "page3.php" and "login.php"
    in "privato" directory.


    username: logout    password: logout

    * Because there is no way to logout, a user "logout" is used to 
    replace the current user when he/she wants to logout. The username 
    "logout" do not have access to restricted files but is the only 
    user that has access to "logout.php". This ensures that when 
    a user wants to logout, the current username and password will be 
    switched to "logout".
