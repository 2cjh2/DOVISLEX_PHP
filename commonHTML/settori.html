    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L11">The Firm provides 
      highly-qualified assistance in the field of agriculture, 
      fisheries, environment. Such assistance often involves dealing
      with public administrations and agencies in the interpretation 
      and application of EU law. In many cases, issues can be 
      resolved at this stage without embarking on a path of 
      litigation. At the same time, the number and importance of 
      the cases argued before the courts of the European Union  
      has been very substantial.
