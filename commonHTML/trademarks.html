    <h1>Intellectual property</h1>

    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L14">Since 2000 the Firm is also active in the field of intellectual property. It is possible to register a EU trade mark through an application to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in Alicante (Spain). 
    </p>

    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L15">The European Trademark, 
      if granted, covers all 28 countries of the European Union for 
      a period of 10 years, and may be renewed. Hence, it is 
      advantageous over applying for a trademark with each individual 
      country (with the associated costs).
    </p>

    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L16"> The European mark confers 
      to its holder protections against reproduction or imitation of 
      its brand throughout the European Union; more specifically, 
      the right to prohibit a third party from using, without his 
      consent,  signs identical or similar to those covered by the 
      trademark (under certain conditions, this right is also 
      extended to products or services other than those for which 
      the trademark is registered).
    </p>

    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="F101"> Under certain circumstances, these actions are possible:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="LcustomTranslation" id="F102">oppose the application by others for registration of a 
        European trademark;
      </li>
      <li class="LcustomTranslationLI" id="L17">initiate an action 
        of invalidity for a trademark already granted to another entity.
      </li>
    </ul>
