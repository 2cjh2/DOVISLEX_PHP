    <h1>Contracts</h1>

    <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="F91">In order to protect your commercial interests it is now more important than ever not to rely on mere verbal or short written agreements, but to think through and write down in detail - the intended functioning of a business relationship. The more thorough the preparation of the relevant contractual clauses (which take into account the applicable substantive and procedural law), the more protection one has in the judicial and extrajudicial defense of one's rights in case of a default by the trading partner.

      numerous distribution agreements, with particular attention 
      to the problems - often underestimated by clients - of

      protection of competition laid down in European law.
